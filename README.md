Following along with the University of Utah Ray Tracing course in which, over the semester, the students implement various direct illumination features and, ultimately, implement indirect illumination features.

The above image is a culmination of implementing algorithms to support
- coordinate space transformations: screen, camera, world, object
- recursive scene graph scaling
- naïve lighting: ambient, diffuse, specular
- naïve shadow rays
- recursive reflective lighting
- recursive refractive lighting
- polygonal meshes via Möller-Trumbore

I immediately realized the difficulties that would result from attempting to follow along _outside_ the class, however didn't give up and worked my way through the first 5 projects before branching off and approaching global illumination. Perhaps the most useful resource I've encounted thus far is Dr. Shirley's [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/fcg4/).
